### Configuring Credentials

Trasheddit requires the following credential information:

- client_id
- client_secret
- password

The Reddit API requires that tools like trasheddit utilize their own authentication mechanism to access your specific user account. The `password` should be the login password associated with the `username` that the script is being run on.

To obtain the client ID and secret, follow these steps (taken from the [PRAW documentation](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html#script-application)):

1. Open your Reddit application preferences by clicking [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/).
2. Add a new application. It doesn't matter what it's named, but calling it "trasheddit" makes it easier to remember.
3. Select "script".
4. Redirect URL does not matter for script applications, so enter something like http://127.0.0.1:8080
5. Once created, you should see the name of your application followed by 14 character string. Enter this 14 character string as your `client_id`.
6. Copy the 27 character "secret" string into the `client_secret` field.

The program will then create a file storing these credentials for future use. Assuming this file is not deleted, you will only need to complete this process once per account.
